	 * like automatic word-completion, code navigation, or code checking have become popular across different tools for different
	 * programming languages.
	 *
	 * The editor provides an API that makes it simple to provide such common features by having all UI and actions already in place and
	 * by allowing you to participate by providing data only. For instance, to contribute a hover all you have to do is provide a function
	 * that can be called with a [TextDocument](#TextDocument) and a [Position](#Position) returning hover info. The rest, like tracking the
	 * mouse, positioning the hover, keeping the hover stable etc. is taken care of by the editor.
	 *
	 * ```javascript
	 * languages.registerHoverProvider('javascript', {
	 * 	provideHover(document, position, token) {
	 * 		return new Hover('I am a hover!');
	 * 	}
	 * });
	 * ```
	 *
	 * Registration is done using a [document selector](#DocumentSelector) which is either a language id, like `javascript` or
	 * a more complex [filter](#DocumentFilter) like `{ language: 'typescript', scheme: 'file' }`. Matching a document against such
	 * a selector will result in a [score](#languages.match) that is used to determine if and how a provider shall be used. When
	 * scores are equal the provider that came last wins. For features that allow full arity, like [hover](#languages.registerHoverProvider),
	 * the score is only checked to be `>0`, for other features, like [IntelliSense](#languages.registerCompletionItemProvider) the
	 * score is used for determining the order in which providers are asked to participate.

		 * 2. A string will be desugared to become the `language`-part of a [`DocumentFilter`](#DocumentFilter), so `"fooLang"` is like `{ language: "fooLang" }`.

		 *  2. When `scheme`, `language`, or `pattern` are defined but one doesn’t match, the result is `0`
		 *  3. Matching against `*` gives a score of `5`, matching via equality or via a glob-pattern gives a score of `10`
		 *  4. The result is the maximun value of each match
		 *
		 * Samples:
		 * ```js
		 * // default document from disk (file-scheme)
