/**
 * The Anomaly Detector API detects anomalies automatically in time series data.
 * It supports two kinds of mode, one is for stateless using, another is for
 * stateful using. In stateless mode, there are three functionalities. Entire
 * Detect is for detecting the whole series with model trained by the time series,
 * Last Detect is detecting last point with model trained by points before.
 * ChangePoint Detect is for detecting trend changes in time series. In stateful
 * mode, user can store time series, the stored time series will be used for
 * detection anomalies. Under this mode, user can still use the above three
 * functionalities by only giving a time range without preparing time series in
 * client side. Besides the above three functionalities, stateful model also
 * provide group based detection and labeling service. By leveraging labeling
 * service user can provide labels for each detection result, these labels will be
 * used for retuning or regenerating detection models. Inconsistency detection is
 * a kind of group based detection, this detection will find inconsistency ones in
 * a set of time series. By using anomaly detector service, business customers can
 * discover incidents and establish a logic flow for root cause analysis.
